- S-Series Led Demo: Demo Application that showcases the individual led control (S-Series only,  API required)

_To Come_:
- NFC Demo: Test the full functionality of the integrated or external NFC capabilities
- Radar Demo: Test the functionalities of the Radar Motion Sensor
- Camera: Test some of the different ways to implement the camera on your APPC device
- Scanner: See what is possible with the barcode scanner

## Installation
- Download the App from the releases tab.

- Either:
  - Transfer to USB stick
  - Insert USB into APPC device
  - Install using USB

### LED Demo
The LED Demo demonstrates how the LEDs are controlled via either SDK or ProDVX API.
In this menu, the LED Demo for S-Series can als be found.

### Adaptive Light
This service enables the device to recognize specific datapoints from the display and sends the RGB data to the LEDs.\
_**Setting datapoints**_: You can set the datapoints by increasing/decreasing the offsets from the edge of the screen, indicated with red lines.\
_**Fuzzing values**_: Fuzzing the datapoints grabs pixels around the absolute pixel and averages the RGB data before sending it to the LEDs. It is also possible to turn this function off or increase/decrease the amount of pixels around the base point to be collected.\
_**Test Image**_: Set a test image that is applied to the background of the screen to test the offsets, incase of content with black bars.
